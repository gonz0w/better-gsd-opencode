# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-28)

**Core value:** Manage and deliver high-quality software with high-quality documentation, while continuously reducing token usage and improving performance
**Current focus:** v7.1 Trajectory Engineering — Phase 45 Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 45 of 50 (Foundation — Decision Journal & State Coherence)
Plan: —
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-02-28 — Roadmap created for v7.1 (6 phases, 22 requirements)

Progress: [████████████████████░░░░░░░░░░] 100/100 plans complete (v1.0-v7.0) | v7.1: 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 100 (85 across v1.0-v6.0 + 15 in v7.0)
- Average duration: ~15 min/plan
- Total execution time: ~25 hours

**By Milestone:**

| Milestone | Phases | Plans | Timeline |
|-----------|--------|-------|----------|
| v1.0 | 5 | 14 | 2 days |
| v1.1 | 4 | 10 | 1 day |
| v2.0 | 4 | 13 | 3 days |
| v3.0 | 4 | 10 | 1 day |
| v4.0 | 5 | 13 | 1 day |
| v5.0 | 7 | 14 | 2 days |
| v6.0 | 7 | 11 | 1 day |
| v7.0 | 8 | 15 | 2 days |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All v1.0-v7.0 decisions recorded in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table with outcomes.

### Pending Todos

None — milestone starting fresh.

### Blockers/Concerns

- 3 pre-existing test failures in context-budget (plan path validation) — carried from v6.0
- Phase 45 (Foundation): STATE.md coherence during pivot is the #1 architectural risk — selective checkout design must be proven before building commands on top
- Phase 47 (Pivot): Selective checkout edge cases need careful testing — files added/deleted since checkpoint, `.planning/` files created during attempt
