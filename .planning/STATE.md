# Project State

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-03-13)

**Core value:** Manage and deliver high-quality software with high-quality documentation, while continuously reducing token usage and improving performance
**Current focus:** v11.3 LLM Offloading — Phase 110 (Audit & Decision Framework)

## Current Position

**Phase:** 110 (Audit & Decision Framework)
**Current Plan:** —
**Status:** Ready to plan
**Last Activity:** 2026-03-13 — Roadmap created for v11.3 LLM Offloading (3 phases: 110-112)

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Execution Notes

**Phase 108 (dead-code-removal):** Executed 2026-03-12
- Plan 108-01: Static analysis with ESLint (0 unreachable code found)
- Plan 108-02: Confirmed codebase is clean - no removals needed

**Phase 109 (duplicate-code-merge):** Completed 2026-03-12
- Ran jscpd duplicate detection, found 40+ blocks
- Applied clarity-over-DRY principle, skipped consolidations
- Test suite and build verified clean

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 207 (v1.0-v11.0)
- Average duration: ~15 min/plan
- Total execution time: ~38 hours

**Current milestone profile:**

| Milestone | Phases | Requirements | Status |
|-----------|--------|--------------|--------|
| v11.3 | 3 (110-112) | 10 | Not Started |
| v11.2 | 4 (106-109) | 15 | Complete |
| v11.1 | 4 (103-105) | 9 | Complete |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- [v11.3 roadmap]: 3 phases derived from 10 requirements across 3 categories (Audit, Engine, Flow)
- [v11.3 roadmap]: Phase ordering: Audit (110) → Engine (111) → Integration (112) — can't build engine without knowing what to offload, can't integrate without engine
- [v11.3 roadmap]: Research recommends zero new dependencies — all patterns proven in existing codebase
- [v11.3 roadmap]: Progressive confidence model (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) gates all decisions — never kills LLM escape hatch
- [v11.3 roadmap]: Estimated ~39K tokens/session savings from P1 offloading opportunities

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

None — research complete with HIGH confidence, ready for planning.

## Session Continuity
