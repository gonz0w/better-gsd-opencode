## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All v1.0 and v1.1 decisions recorded in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table with outcomes.
v2.0 decision: Platform target is OpenCode only (Claude Code version stays as-is).
v2.0 decision: May introduce bundled dependencies if they demonstrably reduce tokens or improve quality.
v2.0 decision: Zero new npm runtime dependencies — all v2.0 features use Node.js built-ins only.
v2.0 decision: Dual-store pattern — STATE.md (human-readable, authoritative) + memory.json (machine-optimized, advisory).
v2.0 decision: Advisory-only state validation first — never blocks workflows, warns only.
