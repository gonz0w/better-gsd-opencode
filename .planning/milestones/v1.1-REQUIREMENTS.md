# Requirements Archive: GSD Plugin v1.1

**Defined:** 2026-02-22
**Completed:** 2026-02-22
**Core Value:** Every improvement must make the plugin more reliable and faster for developers using GSD to plan and execute real projects

## v1.1 Requirements — All Complete

### Measurement & Baselines

- [x] **MEAS-01**: CLI provides accurate token estimation for any text input using tokenx library — Phase 6, validated
- [x] **MEAS-02**: Token baselines are measured for each of the 32 workflow invocations — Phase 6, validated
- [x] **MEAS-03**: User can run before/after comparison showing token reduction per workflow — Phase 6, validated

### CLI Output Reduction

- [x] **CLIP-01**: User can pass `--fields` flag to any JSON command to return only specified fields — Phase 6, validated
- [x] **CLIP-02**: Init commands support `--compact` flag returning essential-only data (46.7% avg reduction) — Phase 7, validated
- [x] **CLIP-03**: Init commands return context manifests telling agents which files/sections to load — Phase 7, validated

### Workflow Compression

- [x] **WKFL-01**: Large reference files are split so agents load only relevant sections — Phase 8, validated
- [x] **WKFL-02**: CLI supports selective markdown section extraction (load specific headers from files) — Phase 8, validated
- [x] **WKFL-03**: Repeated boilerplate across workflow files is deduplicated into shared references — Phase 8, validated
- [x] **WKFL-04**: Research output supports summary/detail tiers for context-aware loading — Phase 8, validated

### Tech Debt

- [x] **DEBT-01**: `roadmap analyze` test passes (fix expected vs actual percentage) — Phase 9, validated
- [x] **DEBT-02**: All 44 top-level commands have `--help` text and no-command usage string is complete — Phase 9, validated
- [x] **DEBT-03**: Generic plan template files exist in `templates/plans/` (execute, tdd, discovery) — Phase 9, validated

## Traceability

| Requirement | Phase | Outcome |
|-------------|-------|---------|
| MEAS-01 | Phase 6 | Validated — tokenx ~96% accuracy |
| MEAS-02 | Phase 6 | Validated — 43 workflows measured |
| MEAS-03 | Phase 6 | Validated — compare subcommand with delta |
| CLIP-01 | Phase 6 | Validated — dot-notation + array support |
| CLIP-02 | Phase 7 | Validated — 46.7% avg reduction |
| CLIP-03 | Phase 7 | Validated — dynamic manifests with sections |
| WKFL-01 | Phase 8 | Validated — extract-sections + markers |
| WKFL-02 | Phase 8 | Validated — dual-boundary parsing |
| WKFL-03 | Phase 8 | Validated — 54.6% avg compression |
| WKFL-04 | Phase 8 | Validated — compact XML tiers |
| DEBT-01 | Phase 9 | Validated — 202/202 tests pass |
| DEBT-02 | Phase 9 | Validated — 44 commands complete |
| DEBT-03 | Phase 9 | Validated — 3 templates created |

**Coverage:** 13/13 requirements validated (100%)

## Future Requirements (Deferred)

- **ACTX-01**: Progressive workflow step loading
- **ACTX-02**: Automated workflow regression testing
- **ACTX-03**: `--precise` flag for exact BPE token counting
- **ACTX-04**: Default `--compact` mode (breaking change)

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| RAG / vector search | Wrong architecture — GSD is a CLI tool |
| LLM-based summarization | Deterministic compression outperforms (JetBrains NeurIPS 2025) |
| Conversation compaction | Host tool's responsibility |
| Token truncation | Selective loading is strictly better |
